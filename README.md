Interaction research.*

Pre-requisites
--------------

The playground depends on 2 QtQuick extensions:

- [Box2D for QtQuick](https://github.com/qml-box2d/qml-box2d) for 2D physics
- my own [ROS plugin for QtQuick](https://github.com/severin-lemaignan/ros-qml-plugin)

Install both before running the playground application.

Installation
------------

Simply open the Qt project from QtCreator and run it from there.
